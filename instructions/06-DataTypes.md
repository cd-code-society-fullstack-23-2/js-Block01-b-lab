**Lab Exercise: Introduction to Understanding Data Types with Functions**

**Objective:** In this lab, you will learn about different data types in JavaScript. You will create functions that return different types of data. The returned values will then be printed to the console using `console.log()`.

**Challenge Goal:** Create functions that return a string, a number, a boolean, and an array. Then print the returned value of each function using `console.log()`.

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 1.5 hours

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a JavaScript file:**
    - Create a new file `src/dataTypes.js`.

2. **Create functions that return different types of data:**
    - In the newly created file, write a function that returns a string.
        ```javascript
        function returnString() {
          return "This is a string";
        }

        console.log(returnString());  // "This is a string"
        ```
    - Next, write a function that returns a number.
        ```javascript
        function returnNumber() {
          return 42;
        }

        console.log(returnNumber());  // 42
        ```
    - Write a function that returns a boolean value.
        ```javascript
        function returnBoolean() {
          return true;
        }

        console.log(returnBoolean());  // true
        ```
    - Finally, write a function that returns an array.
        ```javascript
        function returnArray() {
          return ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
        }

        console.log(returnArray());  // ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        ```
    - Save and run your file. You should see the returned values of each function printed in the console.

Congratulations, you've successfully learned about different data types in JavaScript and how to use them in functions, and completed this lab!

**Note:** Learning to code involves lots of exploration and trial and error. Don't be afraid to experiment with returning different types of data in your functions.
