# Hella Loops

Welcome to the Hella Loops exercise! This exercise is designed to help you practice using loops in JavaScript. Loops are powerful tools that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, making your programs more efficient and concise.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will be working with the `NumberUtilities` class, which contains various methods that perform different tasks using loops. Your goal is to complete the implementation of these methods to achieve the desired functionality. Each method should return a string representation of the output.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercise, follow these steps:

1. **Create a JavaScript file:**

- Create a new file `src/hellaLoops.js`.

1. **Setup:** Ensure that you have a code editor installed on your computer. If you don't have one, you can use online editors like Replit or Glitch.

2. **Clone the Repository:** If the exercise materials are provided in a repository, clone the repository to your local machine. If not, create a new file in your code editor and save it with a `.js` extension.

3. **Open the File:** Open the `NumberUtilities.js` file in your code editor. This file contains the skeleton code for the `NumberUtilities` class, and it's where you'll be working.

4. **Understanding the Methods:** Take a look at the methods you need to implement. Each method has a description that explains what it should do. Read the descriptions carefully to understand the requirements.

5. **Coding:** Write your code inside the corresponding method stubs in the `NumberUtilities` class. Use loops and any other necessary statements to achieve the desired functionality.

6. **Testing:** After implementing each method, you can test your code to ensure it works correctly. You can use the provided test cases in the `HellaLoopsTest.js` file or create your own test cases to verify the output.

7. **Running the Tests:** To run the tests and see the output of your code, follow the instructions in the `HellaLoopsTest.js` file. Running the tests will help you identify any issues in your code and ensure that your implementation is correct.

8. **Customization:** Feel free to experiment and customize your code. You can modify the methods, create additional test cases, or explore different approaches to solve the tasks. This will help you deepen your understanding of loops and improve your coding skills.

## Example Inputs and Outputs

To give you an idea of how the methods should work, here are some example inputs and the corresponding expected outputs:

- **Method:** `getRange(stop)`
  - **Input:** `stop = 11`
  - **Output:** `"012345678910"`

- **Method:** `getRange(start, stop)`
  - **Input:** `start = 5, stop = 11`
  - **Output:** `"5678910"`

- **Method:** `getRange(start, stop, step)`
  - **Input:** `start = 5, stop = 20, step = 5`
  - **Output:** `"51015"`

- **Method:** `getEvenNumbers(start, stop)`
  - **Input:** `start = 5, stop = 20`
  - **Output:** `"681012141618"`

- **Method:** `getOddNumbers(start, stop)`
  - **Input:** `start = 5, stop = 20`
  - **Output:** `"5791113151719"`

- **Method:** `getSquareNumbers(start, stop)`
  - **Input:** `start = 5, stop = 20`
  - **Output:** `"25100225"`

- **Method:** `getExponentiations(start, stop, step, exponent)`
  - **Input:** `start = 5, stop = 20, step = 5, exponent = 2`
  - **Output:** `"25100225"`

Remember, these are just examples, and your code should handle various inputs within the specified requirements.

## Final Thoughts

Working on this exercise will help you become more comfortable with loops and improve your coding skills. Make sure to read the instructions, understand the requirements, and test your code thoroughly.

Don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties or need clarification. Remember, coding is all about exploring, learning, and having fun! Good luck, and happy coding!
